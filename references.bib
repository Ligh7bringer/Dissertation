	abstract = {This study analyzed how communication changes when people communicate with an intelligent agent as opposed to with another human. We compared 100 instant messaging conversations to 100 exchanges with the popular chatbot Cleverbot along seven dimensions: words per message, words per conversation, messages per conversation, word uniqueness, and use of profanity, shorthand, and emoticons. A MANOVA indicated that people communicated with the chatbot for longer durations (but with shorter messages) than they did with another human. Additionally, human-chatbot communication lacked much of the richness of vocabulary found in conversations among people, and exhibited greater profanity. These results suggest that while human language skills transfer easily to human-chatbot communication, there are notable differences in the content and quality of such conversations.},

These efforts were originally called natural language understanding, which is now more frequently called natural language processing (NLP). NLP is considered a branch of artificial intelligence (AI), but over the years it has become an interesting area of study in computational statistics and text data mining. NLP encompasses approaches that use computers to analyze, determine semantic similarity, and translate between languages. The area usually deals with written languages, but it could also be applied to speech. In this article, we cover definitions and concepts necessary for the understanding of NLP, methods at the word and sentence level (word sense disambiguation, part-of-speech tagging, and parsing), and the vector space model for NLP at the document level.

However, it is still difficult to build and deploy chatbots. Developers need to handle the coordination of the cognitive services to build the chatbot interface, integrate the chatbot with external services, and worry about extensibility, scalability, and maintenance. In this work, we present the architecture and prototype of a chatbot using a serverless platform, where developers compose stateless functions together to perform useful actions. We describe our serverless architecture based on function sequences, and how we used these functions to coordinate the cognitive microservices in the Watson Developer Cloud to allow the chatbot to interact with external services. The serverless model improves the extensibility of our chatbot, which currently supports 6 abilities: location based weather reports, jokes, date, reminders, and a simple music tutor.},

	abstract = {CSIEC (Computer Simulation in Educational Communication) system with newly developed multiple functions for English instruction still focuses on supplying a virtual chatting partner (chatbot), which can chat in English with the English learners anytime anywhere. It generates communicative response according to the user input, the dialogue context, the user's and its own personality knowledge, common sense knowledge, and inference knowledge. All these kinds of knowledge are expressed in the form of NLML, an annotation language for natural language text. These NLMLs can either be automatically obtained through parsing the text, or be easily authored with the help of GUI editors designed by us. So the CSIEC system suggests a na{\"{i}}ve approach of logical reasoning and inference directly through syntactical and semantic analysis of textual knowledge. This approach has advantages over the old ELIZA-like keywords matching mechanism. The chatting log summarization of free Internet usage within six months demonstrates this advantage.

On these premises, we consider four attributes: "support of a minimal set of common commands", "foresee language variations in both inputs and ouput", "human-assistance provision" and "timeliness". These attributes are worked out for the 100 most popular chatbots in Facebook Messager. The aim is to look for correlations between these attributes and chatbot popularity in terms of number of "likes". Results show that there is no significance correlation with any of the attributes. However, the experiment come up with two main insights. First, the lack of common communication paterns that would permit users to move their experiences and expectations from one chatbot to another.

This paper investigates various issues related to a political chatterbot where human agents are politically opinionated. Here, understanding the latent intent of human agent is crucial for developing an efficient political chatterbot. We set our study in the context of 2016 Brexit referendum. We argue that employing a subjectivity detector and an emotion analyzer, in addition to the keyword based topic detector, enhances the intent detection process. Next, we discuss the importance of maintaining political neutrality. To maintain its neutrality, a chatterbot needs to disassociate itself from a politically opinionated response. This can be achieved by associating a response with a user or a set of users. Nowadays, the Twitter platform provides an enormous amount of user-generated contents for various socio-economic events. Hence, we have considered tweet feeds for developing the overall chatterbot architecture in the political domain.},

Software to machine-learn conversational patterns from a transcribed dialogue corpus has been used to generate a range of chatbots speaking various languages and sublanguages including varieties of English, as well as French, Arabic and Afrikaans. This paper presents a program to learn from spoken transcripts of the Dialogue Diversity Corpus of English, the Minnesota French Corpus, the Corpus of Spoken Afrikaans, the Qur'an Arabic-English parallel corpus, and the British National Corpus of English; we discuss the problems which arose during learning and testing. Two main goals were achieved from the automation process. One was the ability to generate different versions of the chatbot in different languages, bringing chatbot technology to languages with few if any NLP resources: the corpus-based learning techniques transferred straightforwardly to develop chatbots for Afrikaans and Qur'anic Arabic. The second achievement was the ability to learn a very large number of categories within a short time, saving effort and errors in doing such work manually: we generated more than one million AIML categories or conversation-rules from the BNC corpus, 20 times the size of existing AIML rule-sets, and probably the biggest AI Knowledge-Base ever.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

An algorithm for suffix stripping is described, which has been implemented as a short, fast program in BCPL. Although simple, it performs slightly better than a much more elaborate system with which it has been compared. It effectively works by treating complex suffixes as compounds made up of simple suffixes, and removing the simple suffixes in a number of steps. In each step the removal of the suffix is made to depend upon the form of the remaining stem, which usually involves a measure of its syllable length. }

@misc{Kotsiantis2007,
	abstract = {Supervised machine learning is the search for algorithms that reason from externally supplied instances to produce general hypotheses, which then make predictions about future instances. In other words, the goal of supervised learning is to build a concise model of the distribution of class labels in terms of predictor features. The resulting classifier is then used to assign class labels to the testing instances where the values of the predictor features are known, but the value of the class label is unknown. This paper describes various supervised machine learning classification techniques. Of course, a single article cannot be a complete review of all supervised machine learning classification algorithms (also known induction classification algorithms), yet we hope that the references cited will cover the major theoretical issues, guiding the researcher in interesting research directions and suggesting possible bias combinations that have yet to be explored.},

@article{Pereira2018,
	abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 ACM. This work introduces a set of quality attributes for chatbots. The selection is grounded on scholarly but also reputed blog references from 2016 and 2017. In addition, attributes should be amenable to be extracted (semi) automatically. On these premises, we consider four attributes: "support of a minimal set of common commands", "foresee language variations in both inputs and ouput", "human-assistance provision" and "timeliness". These attributes are worked out for the 100 most popular chatbots in Facebook Messager. The aim is to look for correlations between these attributes and chatbot popularity in terms of number of "likes". Results show that there is no significance correlation with any of the attributes. However, the experiment come up with two main insights. First, the lack of common communication paterns that would permit users to move their experiences and expectations from one chatbot to another. Second, the existence of many programming errors that reflect that bot programming is still a nascent area.},
